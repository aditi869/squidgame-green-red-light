🟢🔴 Green Light, Red Light Game

An interactive web-based game inspired by Squid Game.
The player can only move during Green Light and must stop during Red Light — moving at the wrong time ends the game.

How It Works
Start the game 🎮
Light randomly switches between Green 🟢 and Red 🔴
Player moves only when the light is Green
If the player moves during Red, ❌ Game Over
Reach the finish line to win 🎉
